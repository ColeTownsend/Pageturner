# A simple responsive Octopress theme

There isn't a very wide choice of Octopress themes out there, so I decided
to make my own. It's inspired heavily by Simon Foster's blog
(http://simonfosterdesign.com/blog/), relying mostly on typography (all
typographical elements are stored as variables for simple customization).

## Install

	cd octopress/.themes
	git clone https://github.com/elisehein/Pageturner.git
	rake install\[Pageturner\]
	rake generate
